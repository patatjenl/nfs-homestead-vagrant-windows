# Using NFS in Homestead / Vagrant on Windows

- Navigate to your Homestead directory, for me that's `~/Homestead`.
- Install NFS for vagrant: `vagrant plugin install vagrant-winnfsd`
- SSH into the VM: `vagrant ssh %ip/hostname of the VM%`
- Edit Homestead config: `nano ~/.homestead/Homestead.yaml`, 
- Within the file, add `type: "nfs"` to `folders`


## Oh my ZSH

Optional, but fun addition: Check out Oh-My-ZSH. It's pretty damn cool. 

```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install zsh -y && sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```
